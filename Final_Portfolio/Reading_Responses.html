        <h3> Oops, You are forced to hear my ramblings</h3>
        <h5>Ulises Carrion - Mail Art and the Big Monster from Second Thoughts</h5>
        <p>The text itself is very well-written and absurdly captivating. I feel very resonated with the idea that “post
          is not the medium” because it is not required to understand how the postal network functions when creating
          mail art, and that figuring out the system does not automatically qualify one as a mail artist. I want to draw
          parallel to the process of making generative art which also relies on an “autonomous system” - artists
          themselves are not essentially the best people to explain the codes that made the art but it is the process of
          human intervention and the ideas to convey that matters.
          <br>I am also trying to understand the “Is Mail Art unpretentious… Is Mail Art democratic…?” part, as it
          insinuates that even though Mail Arts circumvents the traditional (institutional?) process/hierarchy an artist
          needs to pass through to earn visibility, one artist can still outshine another. It almost feels like how
          social media works today. But I cannot comprehend Carrion’s idea of this part.<br>

          Discussion questions:<br>
          • What exactly is the “Monster” and the “Castle”? (the institution?) (Speaking in internet slangs does that
          mean the power of shadow banning) (I am joking though)<br>
          • About the receiving end of Mail Arts, what happens if the correspondents interpret the same message
          differently?<br>

        <h5>Laurel Schwulst & Édouard U - Selections from Creative Independent and Arena How Do You Use the Internet
          Mindfully</h5>
        <p>Laurel Schwulst text:<br><br>
          • I found myself resonate so much with the sentence “In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these
          platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you”. I for one as a creator, have never found a place for
          myself on those world’s largest social media platforms as the other “content creators” did who had accumulated
          a huge fanbase by tirelessly producing fragments of information and feed them into the web. I always feel that
          the mechanism of those social networks counters the nature of creative process which usually requires a
          certain amount of solitude for consistency and self-reflection that leads to fruitful result, instead of
          overexposing the creator themselves instead of the subject.
          • I love the metaphor of personal websites as a garden. Making a personal website for myself has been a very
          eye-opening experience as it changed my way of documenting my own works and subconsciously helped me to steer
          my way in my own artistic journey.<br><br>
          Édouard U. text <br><br>
          • “I believe conceptual isolation creates the death of meaning. For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt
          discomfort towards the feeling of being cognitively hemmed in or ‘led along’ in a linear manner.” I agreed
          with this statement but partially agreed with the “read two or more books at the same time” methodology
          because not every one can naturally deconstruct the knowledge presented to them, and there is a risk of
          developing the habit of understanding the world in a fragmented way.
          Discussion Questions: What’s your opinion on Édouard U.’s methodology of immediately and intentionally
          interrelating the cultural inputs?

        <h5>Olia Lialina - STILL THERE Ruins and Templates of Geocities from Lost and Living (in) Archives</h5>
        <p>Olia Lialina’s STILL THERE: Ruins and Templates of GeoCities from Lost and Living (in) Archives made me
          reflect on how much the internet has changed since the days of early, DIY web culture. She describes how
          broken links, archived pages, and missing images serve as digital ruins—reminders of a time when the internet
          felt more personal and free. Unlike today’s streamlined, algorithm-driven platforms, GeoCities sites were
          messy, experimental, and deeply individual. Their disappearance, along with corporate takeovers, feels like a
          loss of agency in how we present ourselves online. <br><br>
          I’ve spent time browsing old GeoCities pages through the Wayback Machine, and there’s something haunting yet
          fascinating about seeing remnants of forgotten sites—half-loaded graphics, blinking text, personal homepages
          frozen in time. It makes me wonder: As we move toward polished, templated spaces, are we losing the raw
          individuality that once defined the web? Or is self-expression just evolving within new constraints, shaped by
          the platforms we use today?

        <h5>Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer - Selections from Publishing from Post-Digital-Print</h5>
        <p>1- “Print, however, is a very different case, since the medium – the printed page – is more than just a
          carrier for things to be shown on some display, it is also the display itself” – this reminds me of Ulises
          Carrión’s text on mail art saying that mail is not the medium until the act of using the postal system is
          considered part of the creative process of mail art. Print itself can also have character.<br><br>
          2- I enjoyed the idea of hybrid forms of digital and analog and now that we can have a word to categorize some
          innovative printing techniques such as AR interactive prints – by scanning the QR code on a piece of paper you
          are dragged into the augmented reality world on your phone screen, so you are using your mobile phone to
          “read” a print - a hybrid. <br><br>

          Discussion questions: Can we extend the Print vs. Electrons glossary?

        <h5>Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan - Selections from Alt-Text as Poetry Workbook</h5>
        <p>“Alt text has tremendous expression potential” – There has been speculation that alt texts are also used for
          AI training as it makes the image legible to AI. Sometimes we can also see content creators encourage using
          alt text in a post to let the algorithm do their favor. I find it very interesting that one may not describe
          the image in a literal way or even they don’t have to write anything relevant to the image, but alt text can
          reach unexpected audience regardless. <br><br>

          I also find the process of integrating alt text into creative work revealing, particularly in how it forces
          artists to confront their own visual assumptions. Writing descriptions for my own images, I realized how
          easily intent and perception can diverge. Going back and forth between image creation and subsequent alt text
          writing, it very much feels like a self-critique process. <br><br>
          Discussion questions:
          • While alt text can be an insightful tool, it is also labor-intensive. If the artists ask for external help
          to describe their own work, would the process truly make their art more accessible?

        <h5>Ramsey Nasser - "A Personal Computer for Children of All Cultures" from Decolonising the Digital</h5>
        <p>Ramsey Nasser critiques how computing infrastructure enforces English dominance, marginalizing non-Latin
          scripts and limiting global accessibility. He highlights how programming’s reliance on English isn’t just
          technical but ideological, reinforcing colonial biases in digital spaces. His Arabic-based programming
          language, "قلب" (Qalb), challenges this norm, exposing resistance to non-English code as more than a
          logistical issue—it’s an exclusionary design choice. <br><br>
          This made me reconsider how we accept English as the default in programming without questioning its
          consequences. Computing is often framed as universal, yet linguistic barriers make it inaccessible to
          millions. If coding languages embraced multilingualism, how would that reshape global participation in
          technology? Would it redefine who has the power to create and innovate?

        <p5>David Reinfurt - Selections from A *New* Program for Graphic Design</p5>
        <p>Reinfurt’s discussion of Gestalt psychology and its influence on design caught my attention, especially the
          example of the rotating beach ball as a waiting symbol. It’s fascinating how a simple visual cue can create an
          intuitive sense of time and anticipation, reinforcing the way our brains seek patterns and context. This
          connects to branding, where designers carefully craft visual identities that communicate meaning beyond just
          logos. Paul Rand’s approach, which Reinfurt highlights, embodies this—he saw branding as more than just
          aesthetics; it was about creating immediate recognition and emotional resonance. Rand’s IBM and ABC logos, for
          example, distill complex ideas into simple yet powerful forms that remain effective over time. <br><br>
          This made me think about how much of design relies on subconscious cues. <br><br>
          My question is: How can designers balance simplicity and depth in branding, ensuring symbols remain both
          intuitive and meaningful across different cultural and technological shifts?

        <h5>Dot Tuer - Beyond the New Media Frame The Poetics of Absence in Vera Frenkel’s String Games</h5>
        <p>"Frenkel realized a space in between conceptual and technological affirmations of presence. By substituting
          the predetermined figures of Cat'sCradle with the live-stream transmission of improvised sequences, Frenkel
          dematerialized the binding properties of string." <br><br>
          What stands out to me in this section is how Frenkel transforms the idea of Cat’s Cradle into something fluid
          and ephemeral, moving away from fixed figures to something shaped by improvisation and absence. By replacing
          tangible string with live-streamed gestures, she breaks the expectation of continuity, making the gaps—the
          narrative ellipses—just as important as the connections. This reminds me of how digital communication often
          feels: interdependent yet fragmented, where meaning forms in what is left unsaid as much as in what is
          exchanged. It makes me think about how technology changes the way we perceive presence—can something be felt
          even when it isn’t physically there, and how well did modern communication technologies do on this matter?

        <h5>Paul Soulellis - Performing the Feed</h5>
        <p>I was really struck by how Soulellis frames the constant digital feed as both overwhelming and strangely
          intimate—it collapses the boundary between public and private, turning consumption into something emotional
          and immersive. His idea of “publishing like a texture” really resonated with me; it made me realize that I
          often scroll through content not to learn, but to feel something—falling into that semi-aware, “new boredom”
          state he describes. It’s unsettling how natural that rhythm has become. <br><br>

          Soulellis also mentioned how we need to resist the state of endless boredom and voiced his concern about if we
          are prepared to embrace the form of entertainment that is completely automated/generated by algorithms. This
          part reminds me of the most recent debate of generative AI and its impact on entertainment, intellectual
          quality of content and most importantly the value of human creators. <br><br>
          It makes me wonder: as our feeds get smarter, what are we really giving up for the sake of convenience?
          Publishing once meant making an idea heard—carving out space for a voice. But in an age where everyone is
          constantly posting, is publishing still as powerful, or has it been drowned out by the sheer volume of noise?

        <h5>Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno - Beyond Dark Matter from Logic Issue 15 Beacons</h5>
        <p>What really stayed with me was how the zine uses a fictional story—following Gem and her guides—to talk about
          real issues like surveillance and exclusion. Framing it as a journey made it feel less like a critique and
          more like an invitation to imagine something different. <br><br>
          “The Way” feels like a metaphor for dominant technological norms or algorithms that subtly control behavior,
          while “The Beyond” invokes a realm of imagination, ancestry, and alternate wisdom. It’s a reminder that we can
          step outside these frameworks and define ourselves on our own terms. <br><br>

          “You can’t fix the computer just like you can’t turn back the clock, but you can change what you do now to
          share the work of building a different future,” The Beyond said. “When you feel controlled by The Way, you can
          activate the energy of The Beyond to show you that your computer doesn’t have to define who you are and what
          you’re capable of. Another way is always possible.” <br><br>
          It makes me think: how often do we internalize the limits of our tools without questioning who designed them
          and why?

        <h5>Boris Groys - Art on the Internet</h5>
        <p>"The results of surveillance are sold by the corporations that control the Internet because they own the
          means of production.... One should not forget that the Internet is owned privately." <br><br>
          That part really stands out—Groys reminds us that despite the internet feeling like a public, open space, it's
          actually owned and operated by private corporations who profit off our data. The idea that surveillance is not
          just a byproduct but a business model makes me rethink how we engage with digital platforms. It’s not just
          about expression or sharing—it’s about who benefits from that interaction. The fact that these companies own
          the very structure we rely on for communication and art-making adds a layer of control that often goes
          unnoticed. It raises questions about whether true autonomy in online art is even possible. <br><br>

          What stood out to me is his idea that online art is less about permanence and more about circulation and
          attention. This made me think about how value in digital art isn’t tied to physical presence, but to how often
          and how widely it is seen. -- Online art can go viral in seconds, with or without context. <br><br>

          Is online visibility really the main measure of an artwork’s impact today? how does that change what kind of
          art gets made and shared?
